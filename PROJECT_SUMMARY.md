- Installed MCP SDK, TypeScript, and Zod dependencies

### 2. ✅ MCP Server Implementation
- Implemented proper MCP SDK request handlers (no deprecated methods)
- Created four main resources for project documentation access
- Implemented three tools for simulation, compliance checking, and code analysis
- Added prompt for test scenario generation
- All functionality tested and working

### 3. ✅ Build System
- Successfully builds TypeScript to JavaScript
- Executable permissions set correctly
- VS Code tasks configured for building and testing

### 4. ✅ Testing & Validation

## Usage Instructions

### Development:
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run build        # Build TypeScript
npm test            # Test functionality
npm start           # Run server
```

### VS Code Integration:
Add to VS Code MCP configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opennic-filter-context": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/jonafta/Dev/open-nic-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Verification

The server has been tested with:
- ✅ MCP protocol initialization
- ✅ Resource listing and access
- ✅ Tool availability and schema validation
- ✅ Prompt generation functionality
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases

## Next Steps

The MCP server is ready for use. To integrate with your OpenNIC development workflow:

1. Configure VS Code to use the MCP server (see VSCODE_SETUP.md)
2. Ensure OpenNIC project files are at expected paths
3. Use the server's resources for documentation access
4. Leverage tools for simulation and compliance checking
5. Generate test scenarios using the prompts

## Project Context

This server specifically supports the OpenNIC packet filter project by providing:
- **Hardware Description Context**: SystemVerilog implementation details
- **Verification Environment**: Cocotb-based testbench access
- **Requirements Management**: Compliance checking and validation
- **Documentation Access**: Centralized project documentation

The server expects the OpenNIC project structure at `/Users/jonafta/Dev/open-nic-shell-ji-mb/` but can be adapted for different project locations by modifying the file paths in the server implementation.
