This is an MCP server project for managing OpenNIC packet filter context. The server provides:

1. **Resources**: Access to OpenNIC filter block documentation, requirements, and simulation guides
2. **Tools**: Functions for running simulations, checking compliance, and managing project context
3. **Prompts**: Templates for testing scenarios and requirements validation

Key project focus areas:
- OpenNIC packet filter implementation in SystemVerilog
- Cocotb-based testbench simulation
- Requirements compliance checking
- CSR (Control and Status Register) management
- AXI-Stream packet processing pipeline

When generating code, consider:
- Hardware description language patterns (SystemVerilog)
- Verification methodologies (Cocotb, UVM concepts)
- Network packet processing workflows
- FPGA development best practices
